üí° My Development Approach (For Reviewers/Interviewers)
My approach to building this To-Do application in React.js was centered around component-based architecture, unidirectional data flow, and efficient state management using React Hooks.

Component Decomposition:
I broke down the UI into logical, reusable components:
App.js: The root component, holding the central todos state and managing core logic.
TodoForm.js: For adding new tasks.
TodoList.js: For rendering the collection of TodoItems.
TodoItem.js: For displaying and managing individual tasks (including edit/delete actions).
Centralized State (useState):
The todos array (which contains id, text, and isEditing properties for each task) is managed centrally in App.js using the useState hook. This ensures a single source of truth for all task data.
Unidirectional Data Flow (Props & Callbacks):
Data (todos) flows down from App.js to TodoList.js and then to TodoItem.js via props.
User interactions (like adding, deleting, or editing) trigger callback functions passed down as props from App.js. This allows child components to communicate changes back up to the parent to update the central state.
Immutability:
All state updates (adding, deleting, or editing tasks) are performed immutably. Instead of directly modifying the todos array, new arrays are created using methods like filter() and map() with the spread operator (...). This ensures React correctly detects state changes and optimizes re-renders.
Unique Keys:
When rendering lists of TodoItem components, each item is given a unique key prop (using todo.id). This is crucial for React to efficiently identify, add, remove, and update items in the list.
Modular & Sleek Styling:
CSS is organized into separate files (.css) alongside their respective React components, promoting modularity.
The design emphasizes a sleek and modern aesthetic with subtle shadows, rounded corners, clean typography, and interactive hover effects to enhance user experience.
